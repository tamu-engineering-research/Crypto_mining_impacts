<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project examines the tri-factor of carbon footprint, energy resiliency, and market price impact from large flexible loads in Texas, which is becoming the epicenter of proof-of-works type blockchain computation and cryptocurrency mining. Contrary to a lot of the existing reports, this research reveals for the first time the critical importance of locational impact on all three factors mentioned above.
